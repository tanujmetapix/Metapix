## OpenCV filters
Real time image and video filtering using OpenCV.

### Dependencies
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required dependencies.

Also you need tkinter so run `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` to get that.

### Guide
Use `python image_filter.py -i <image path> -o <Path to save the snapshots>` for image filtering.

Use `python video_filter.py -v <video path> -o <Path to save the snapshots>` for video filtering. By default `-v` is default to `0` which is your webcam.
